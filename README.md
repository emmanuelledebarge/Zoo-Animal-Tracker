# Zoo-Animal-Tracker
This program is a tracker for zoo animals that saves and writes animal data to a text file.

I created an app that allows the user, specfically a zoo employee, enter zoo animals and create records.  Zoo animal records can be created, deleted, and saved.  Each animals is tracked by tracking number, number of eggs, if they are nursing, their type, and sub type.

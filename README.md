# Zoo-Animal-Tracker
This program is a tracker for zoo animals that saves and writes animal data to a text file.

I created an app that allows the user, specfically a zoo employee, enter zoo animals and create records.  Zoo animal records can be created, deleted, and saved.  Each animals is tracked by tracking number, number of eggs, if they are nursing, their type, and sub type. 

The part of the project that I am most proud of is the input validation that I put into the program.  The program will spit out a response if an invalid input is entered.  The user will be prompted to reeenter an input that the program will allow.  

The code is very long, I believe I would enhance the code by going back (after I continue to work on my skills) and seeing if I can shorten some of the code or if there is code that does the same thing with less length.  Less code actually helps make programs more secure.  

I found this program to be challenging and time consuming to write.  I ran into errors when I was trying to loop and often found that the loop was not done in the correct way.  I also learned a lot more about do while loops.  I used a lot of offical C++ documentation from the Microsoft website.  I also used Stack Overflow when I was stuck to help me complete this project. 
 
 The skill that I feel transfers the most to other projects is input validation.  I also learned to search through documentation when I did not know the answers.  Both these skills will help me complete other projects of my own, and projects in the workplace.
 
 I made this program readable by formatting it in a way that was easy for the user.  Input validation also helped because the user will not get some strange bug when entering something that is invalid.  The program is adaptable because it uses things that other languages have in them as well.
